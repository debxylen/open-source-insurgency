# Digital Socialism: Reclaiming Tech, Rebuilding the Future.

## The Great Irony of Data and Tech Companies

Everything nowadays is just stolen from something else. AI companies cry about data theft while having built their models by scraping the internet. The cycle is endless:

- **Company A:** "We trained on public data, so it's fair use!"
- **Company B:** "Wait, you used our data? That's illegal!!"
- **Company C:** "We trained on your model that was trained on stolen data."
- **Company D:** "We used AI to extract AI-generated stuff and claim it as original."

It's a pyramid scheme of stolen knowledge:
They scraped the internet → but now claim "our AI output is protected."
They train on copyrighted work → but when people copy AI-generated stuff, suddenly it's a problem.
If they actually believed their own logic, no AI company would exist today.
So honestly? Might as well take what’s already "borrowed" and make something even better!

## Open Source vs Corporate Gatekeeping

If a company refuses to open-source something but built it using public data, why should anyone respect their closed-off model? It’s just **gatekeeping stolen knowledge.**

- Mods, cracks, and asset rips exist because people want freedom.
- Reverse-engineering software makes it better, faster, and free from corporate greed.
- The best tech is built on top of existing tech, yet companies hoard it instead of advancing progress.
- Open Source projects by individuals often solve problems a company couldn't.

At the end of the day, if it's not open-source, it **deserves** to be "borrowed."

## The Case for Digital Piracy

Piracy is the natural counterbalance to capitalism’s greed. Humanity thrives on sharing knowledge, but capitalism says:

"Nah, paywall everything. Even the stuff we stole."

Legitimate piracy is literally just people reclaiming what should’ve been available to all anyway.

- **Info wants to be free.** Companies want to sell it.
- **Tech wants to evolve.** Corporations want to gatekeep.
- **People want to share.** Capitalism punishes sharing.

Even big corporations pirate ideas:

- Microsoft and Google **steal** from open-source projects constantly.
- Apple **rips off** jailbreak tweaks and calls them "new features."

Capitalism is only good at slowing down progress. People pirate, mod, and hack because that’s the natural state of human innovation.
If companies made things fair and open, piracy wouldn’t be necessary. But they won’t—so people will keep "reclaiming" what should’ve been free. 🏴‍☠️

## True Digital Sovereignity

Not all battles are fought in daylight. Some wield code instead of guns, breaking chains that governments and corporations wrap around freedom. 
They operate not for greed, not for chaos, but to dismantle the illusion of control. 

The right to run, modify, and control your own software, hardware, and data without interference. 
Governments, corporations, and middlemen thrive on gatekeeping, restricting what you can access, modify, or even verify. 

But some refuse to comply. They reverse-engineer walled gardens, liberate locked-down systems, and restore computing to its rightful owners: the users.

These are the operators who don’t just use technology—they own it.

## Digital Socialism

The digital world is ruled by gatekeepers—corporations, centralized services, and walled gardens that dictate who gets access, what can be built, and who profits. 
But the future doesn’t belong to a handful of monopolies—it belongs to everyone who participates in it.

Digital Socialism is about redistributing power in tech. Open-source software, decentralized networks, trustless and permissionless access create a system where users are not just consumers but owners, builders, and maintainers. 
No reliance on a few entities to "keep the lights on"—the system thrives because everyone has skin in the game.

It’s not just privacy—it’s about removing digital dictatorship and monopoly altogether. Our computer, our software, our data.

## Data Ownership

Corporations harvest, process, and profit from user data while giving nothing in return. Every action online generates value, but that value is stolen instead of distributed. 
Digital socialism means flipping the script—users owning their data, deciding how it’s used, and getting paid for the value they create. 

Decentralized networks, better and clearer privacy policies can ensure no single entity holds power over personal information. The internet should be an ecosystem where individuals control their data, not a corporate goldmine.  

## Digital Autonomy 
 
You should have complete control on your device and what runs on it. Closed-source software strip users of real control, and restrict public and individual auditing.
Currently, Big Tech dictates what programs run, what devices stay supported, and who gets access. 

Digital autonomy is about reclaiming this control—owning what is running on our devices (and lives), the data, and the experience itself.

## Licenses: Keeping Tech Truly Free

Licenses like GPLv3 best preserves the spirit of open-source, while licenses like MIT just lets companies yoink your work and sell it back to you.

- MIT is basically:

  "Here, take my open-source code and do whatever."

- And Big Tech goes:

  "Bet. Now it's ours, and you have to pay for it."

- Meanwhile, GPLv3 is like:

  "If you use my code, you have to keep it open-source too."

That’s why companies HATE GPL—they can’t just take your work and close it off.

- Linux? GPL. Microsoft & Apple tried to kill it, but support for Linux got **stronger**.
- Blender? GPL. Autodesk’s monopoly **collapsed**.

The list continues.

## Change & The Fall of Big Tech

People are waking up. They’re supporting **Linus, Blender, DeepSeek R1, and solo devs** instead of billion-dollar corporations.

- Windows 11 is trash: **More people switch to Linux.**
- Autodesk’s monopoly: **Blender destroyed it.**
- OpenAI’s chokehold: **DeepSeek has SHAKEN OpenAI by not only making a faster, cheaper and outperforming model: but also keeping it open-source.**
- Indie devs are eating big companies alive—small teams and solo devs make better software than billion-dollar corporations.

The future isn’t an Apple/Google/Amazon-controlled dystopia. The future is **people-powered, decentralized, and free.**

## Linus Torvalds: The Ultimate Rebel

- Linux? He built it to say "f* you" to proprietary UNIX** because AT&T was hoarding it behind licenses. 
- Git? He made it because BitKeeper (we can accurately say, GateKeeper) tried to gatekeep Linux kernel development. 
- "NVIDIA, f* you!"** – Linus Torvalds, 2012 🖕

As a result:

- Now, Linux runs the entire internet, all supercomputers, and Android.
- Git is the backbone of ALL modern coding—even Microsoft, the king of proprietary software, uses Git.
- NVIDIA was forced to open-source some of their drivers.
- AMD & Intel embraced open-source, gaining a ton of respect.
- Linux gaming is thriving despite NVIDIA’s BS—Steam Deck, Proton, and Vulkan proving we don’t need proprietary garbage.

## The Tech Revolution Spirit

The tech revolution isn’t just about making new stuff—it’s about taking back control from the bloated, greedy corps that hijacked everything.
Tech isn’t just evolving—it’s **revolting.**

- **Web3:** A decentralized web where people don't need to wake up hoping that the node didn't purge their last transaction.
- **Privacy Coins:** The most deserving example would be Monero, where you don’t wake up wondering if your history just became someone else’s business.
- **Self-hosted AI:** No reliance on corporate gatekeepers.
- **Open Source:** Because progress should be free and collective.

The people are **winning:**

- **FOSS software is exploding.**
- **Indie devs outperform million-dollar corps.**
- **AI & tech decentralization is speeding up.**
- **People are waking up to Big Tech’s scams.**

This isn’t just coding. **This is a digital revolution.**

## The First Digital Revolt

Revolution—when you see the system is broken, and you know something better is possible.

- **Big Tech controls everything: data, software, AI, the web.**
- **They "borrow" from the people but lock everything up.**
- **They pretend to be for the people but crush anyone who threatens their power.**

Revolutions **always** start the same way:

1. A small group of people **sees through the lies.**
2. They **start building alternatives.**
3. More people **wake up.**
4. The old system **collapses under its own greed.**

Tech is going through **its own Revolution.**

**And we are the ones holding the flag.** 🏴

## Core Concepts

1. **Information Wants to Be Free**  
   The gatekeeping of open knowledge is unjust. Open knowledge, open-source software, and public access to information and resources must become the new norm.

2. **Exit Over Protest**  
   Instead of begging for change, we create parallel systems. If a platform censors us, we build our own. If an economy enslaves us, we forge alternatives. The future belongs to builders, not beggars.

3. **Privacy is Non-Negotiable**  
   Selling and sharing mass user data is intolerable. Encryption, anonymity, and user-control is not optional—it is mandatory for digital sovereignty.

## Using Proprietary AI to Destroy Proprietary AI

They built AI models using **scraped public data** which was made available freely by sources with one goal: knowledge for all. 
And then they made the models proprietary.

Cool! We use their creation against them.

They hoard proprietary tech behind paywalls?
Fine, we use AI and code to reverse-engineer, recreate, and decentralize it.

They train AI on open-source code but lock the results?
Bet, let’s take help from their models, learn, and train our own models and keep them GPL forever.

AI was meant to be a tool for everyone, not a corporate monopoly.
So if we gotta use their own stolen tech to break the chains, so be it.

They wanted a proprietary AI arms race? 
**We’ll bring open-source nukes to the fight.**

## If Linus Did It Without AI, Why Can’t We?

Linus built **Linux and Git** from scratch in **1991 & 2005—without AI, without billions in funding.** Now, we have:

- **AI-assisted coding** (we can generate frameworks in minutes).
- **Open-source collaboration** (millions of devs ready to fight).
- **More computing power than ever.**

So what’s stopping us?

- Corporate gatekeeping? **We decentralize.**
- Proprietary software? **We replace it.**
- AI monopolies? **We train our own.**

If people back in the 2000s could do it with nothing but pure coding fury, we can obliterate these tech overlords in half the time.

## **The Call to Arms**

This is not a plea. It is not a request. It is a statement of fact: 
The old world is collapsing, and change for the better new has started.

The revolution isn’t coming—it’s **HERE.** And **NOW**.
